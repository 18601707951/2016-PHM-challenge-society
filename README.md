## 2016 PHM challenge society  

The competition is on the data science lesson in NCTU, 2017.  
Competition website: https://www.phmsociety.org/events/conference/phm/16/data-challenge  
***  
    
***#This yearâ€™s challenge is focused on the combination of physics-based modeling and statistical approaches for prediction. It is not required that the solution you select use a physics-based modeling approach. However, additional points will be given to those approaches that provide some physical connection to the data such as health states of various components, relationship between data and model parameters / states, etc.***  
  
***#The system under investigation is a wafer Chemical-Mechanical Planarization (CMP) tool that removes material from the surface of the wafer through a polishing process. Figure 1 depicts the CMP process components and operation. The CMP tool is composed of the following components:***   
*a rotating table used to hold a polishing pad  
*a replaceable polishing pad which is attached to the table  
*a translating and rotating wafer carrier used to hold the wafer  
*a slurry dispenser  
*a translating and rotating dresser used to condition a polishing pad.

The 'rotational speed' is the label what we want to predict.
